# Data Structures & Algorithms - JavaScript
The Ultimate JavaScript Coding Interview & Computer Science Bootcamp

> Description the project.
> Descripci√≥n
This course is different‚Ä¶

After each line of code, an animation of the data structure or algorithm is updated to show exactly what that line of code did.



The animations provide some huge advantages to students:

Increased understanding of the concepts

Greater rate of retention

The material can be covered in a fraction of the time



That means that you can actually learn more material in less time and have higher retention of the material.



That is the key combination of factors to prepare you for the technical interview that lands you your dream job!



I invite you to watch a few of the videos in this course to see what I mean. The difference will be noticeable right away!



I spent over a year to create this course with the goal that an absolute beginner can take it and understand all of the concepts the first time through.



What you will get in this course‚Ä¶

Over 100 hand crafted HD videos that use animations to illustrate technical concepts.



Here is what you will learn in this course:



- Technical

Big O notation



- Data Structures

Arrays

Linked Lists

Doubly Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Binary Trees

Hash Tables

Graphs



- Algorithms

Sorting
